# GetSecularAndDiffusionTimes

Program to calculate the secular and diffusion timescales of a test particle, due to perturbations from a single planet. The equations and explanations are provided in Sec. 5.4 of Pearce & Wyatt (2014), and are based on e.g. Murray & Dermott (1999) and Termaine (1993).

To use the program, simply change the values in the 'User Inputs' section at the start of the code. You should not have to change anything outside of that section.

Note: the secular timescale breaks down if the planet and test particle have the exact same location!

To use the program, first download and unpack the ZIP file (press the green 'Code' button on GitHub, then 'Download ZIP', then unzip the file on your computer). Then navigate to that directory in a terminal, and type e.g. python getSecularAndDiffusionTimes.py

Feel free to use this code, and if the results go into a publication, then please cite Pearce & Wyatt (2014). Also, let me know if you find any bugs or have any requests!
